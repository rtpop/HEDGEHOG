## Introduction
Community detection in large scale biological networks, such as gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is challenging.

Here we present HEDGEHOG, a tool for community detection in genome wide [PANDA](https://netzoo.github.io/zooanimals/panda/panda/) [1] networks. HEDGEHOG contains two modules: ``bihidef``, an adaptation of [HiDef](https://github.com/fanzheng10/HiDeF) [2] for bi-partite networks, and ``hedgehog`` which provides preocessing and filtering of PANDA GRNs for community detection with BiHidef and processing of BiHidef outputs into "regulatory pathways". 

BiHiDef can be used for any bi-partite network as long as it is formatted as a comma separated edgelist, however HEDGEHOG provides filtering and network processing specific to PANDA networks.

## Installation guide
HEDGEHOG is available as a GitHub python package and can be installed with ``pip``.

```
git clone https://github.com/rtpop/HEDGEHOG.git
cd HEDGEHOG
pip .
```
